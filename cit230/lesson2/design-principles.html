                            <p>Hick's Law, in layman terms, states that as the time to make a decision is linked to the number and complexity of choices.  As you can see from Amazon's website, it has a great number of examples.  With so many choices for a user uncertain on what to choose, it can be a little too overwhelming and thus is generally considered not good web design.</p>

                            <p class ="pspec">  The Rule of Thirds is a rule in photography where an image is divided evenly into thirds, both horizontally and vertically.  The subject of the image is located on or near these lines, and is not in the center.  The purpose of this placement is to draw the viewer's eye away from the center, and to other parts of the image.  As you can see from this example, Christ (the subject of the picture) is located to the right of the center, with the Samariatian woman located to the left.  This forces the reader to look to the sides of the image instead of just glancing at the center.</p>

                       <p> One of the most common mistakes with web design is to make our designs too complex.  We have to remember that it is okay to leave white space.  In fact, it has been proven that simpler websites are frequented a whole lot more.  On the sides of this blog, white space is effectively used. </p>
