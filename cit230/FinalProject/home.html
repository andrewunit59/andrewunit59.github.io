        <p>We live in tumlutuous times.  However, there are many sacred places across the whole earth where we can find peace and feel God's love more fully.
           These are the temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  By attending temples, we can recieve personal revelation on what we must be
           doing so that we can stay safe during these times.  Latter-Day prophets and apostles have told us that it is in the temples that we can feel safe.
        </p>
        <h2>A little bit about us.</h2>
        <p>
            We know that there are many Saints who need to travel great distances to attend the temple.  At Temple Inns and Suites, we strive to provide the best
