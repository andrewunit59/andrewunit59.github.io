    <h3>Some Helpful Links</h3>
    <a href="https://militarycac.com/" target="_blank">MilitaryCAC.com</a>- A good link that walks you through step by step on setting up your personal device to view websites on NMCI domain and other CAC enabled websites.  It makes life very convienient as you will not have to travel to the NOSC or nearest
    installation to access an NMCI computer.<br>
    <h3>Some Common Q & A</h3>
    <p>What is NMCI?</p>
    <li>Navy Marine Corps Intranet.  It is the network designed to service the entire Department of the Navy (including both the Navy and the Marine Corps).  All official Navy computers, whether they be at the NOSC or at another Navy base or facility, are linked to the NMCI network.  It has the approprate safeguards to guard
        information that is protected by the Privacy Act of 1975 and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act).  In order to access a computer on the NMCI network, you have to fill out a SAAR-N (System Authorization Access Request-Navy) beforehand.  Your NOSC or organization should have those forms on hand.  You 
        can access most of the Navy's websites through the Online Web Application (OWA) of the respective sites from your own laptop.
    </li>
    <p>What are the best browsers to access Navy websites from?</p>
    <li>All NMCI websites tend to work the best with Internet Explorer.  Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome are also good browsers to use to visit NMCI networks.  I have not been successful in accessing any NMCI website from Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari.  
    </li>
    <p>What is S/MIME, and why can't I see certain content for my email because it isn't enabled?</p>
    <li>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extentions) is a protocol (a widely used method) that encrypts emails and digitally sign them.  They are used for privacy and security. To enable the S/MIME settings on the OWA Outlook, navigate to the top right
        corner until you see the little settings cog (it may be abnormally small), and choose "S/MIME Settings" from the drop-down menu.  Be sure you have S/MIME turned on, and that you have the latest version installed. </li>
