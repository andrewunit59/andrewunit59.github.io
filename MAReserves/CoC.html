            <h4>What is NMCI?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-box-back">
            <p>Navy Marine Corps Intranet.  It is the network designed to service the entire Department of the Navy (including both the Navy and the Marine Corps).  All official Navy computers, whether they be at the NOSC or at another Navy base or facility, are linked to the NMCI network.  It has the approprate safeguards to guard
                information that is protected by the Privacy Act of 1975 and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act).  In order to access a computer on the NMCI network, you have to fill out a SAAR-N (System Authorization Access Request-Navy) beforehand.  Your NOSC or organization should have those forms on hand.  You 
                can access most of the Navy's websites through the Online Web Application (OWA) of the respective sites from your own laptop.</p>

            <h4>What are the best browsers to access Navy websites from?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-box-back">
            <p>All NMCI websites tend to work the best with Internet Explorer.  Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome are also good browsers to use to visit NMCI networks.  I have not been successful in accessing any NMCI website from Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari.</p>

            <h4>What is S/MIME, and why can't I see certain content for my email because it isn't enabled?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-box-back">
            <p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extentions) is a protocol (a widely used method) that encrypts emails and digitally sign them.  They are used for privacy and security. To enable the S/MIME settings on the Outlook OWA (Online Web Application), navigate to the top right
              corner until you see the little settings cog (it may be abnormally small), and choose "S/MIME Settings" from the drop-down menu.  Be sure you have S/MIME turned on, and that you have the latest version installed.</p>

            <h4>Can I plug a USB into an NMCI computer?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-box-back">
            <p>No, it is not authorized to insert removable media (like a thumb drive or USB) into an NMCI computer for a host of security reasons.  Two big reasons why you cannot is the risk of introducing malware to the network and the risk of copying files to the removable media.  If a member does
              insert an unauthorized removable device into an NMCI asset, the NMCI account will be disabled and referred to the Command's Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) for investigation.  Consider using alternatives such as Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store documents.
