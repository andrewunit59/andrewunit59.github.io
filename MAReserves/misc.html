    <h3>New to the Reserves?  Please read the following: </h3>
        <!-- Slideshow container -->
    <section class="slideshow-container">
        <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">1</div>
            <div class="text">While in the Reserves, you will recieve a billet to a command that you will support, most likely a security department of a base somewhere in the world.  You will go to that command for your required Annual Training (AT) period.  You are assigned to a command via a "billet", for where you will
                remain for an average of about 3 years.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">2</div>
            <div class="text">Billets are assigned of in the My Navy Assignment system.  The Unit's Command Career Counselor (CCC) is a good point of contact for any questions you may have regarding billets.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">3</div>
            <div class="text">If you do not have a billet, you are in an IAP status, which if you remain in for too long, you can be separated from the Navy Reserves.  When applying for a billet, it is best when you are new to the Reserves to try and apply for a "local billet", which means you go on AT with the unit you drill with at
                the NOSC.  You are considered "hard billeted".  </div>
          </div>
      
          <div class="mySlides fade">
              <div class="numbertext">4</div>
              <div class="text">You could also be "cross-assigned" which means that even though you drill with a unit at your NOSC, you go on AT with a unit that drills at another NOSC.  You are considered by your drilling unit to be "cross-assigned out" and "cross-assigned in" to the unit you go on AT with.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">5</div>
            <div class="text">If you are cross-assigned, it is of paramount importance that you communicate with both your drilling and cross-assigned units.  Failure to communicate with your cross-assigned unit could result in adverse administrative actions.</div>

    <h3>TRUIC Change</h3>
      <p>A TRUIC Change is when you move NOSCs.  If you do move NOSCs, you will need to do a TRUIC change, which is done through the NOSC's manpower department.  They will provide the form for you to fill out.  It is important to get in contact with your new chain of command as soon as possible.  TRUIC changes can sometimes take several months, so it would
          be wise to reschedule some drills instead of taking AAs while you wait for your TRUIC change (you can have a maximum of 24 Authorized Absences a year, or about 6 months, and then you will be administratively separated).  Your new chain of command can give you further instructions and tell you when to reschedule drills if the TRUIC change is taking a while.  Even though
          you move NOSCs, you will usually still be assigned to the same unit for AT (unless your TRUIC change just happens to coincide with PRD).
