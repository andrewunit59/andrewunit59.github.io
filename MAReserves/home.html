    <h2>Announcements</h2>
    <li>As of February 23, 2020, the Navy will be launching the AT/ADT eMuster, which will eliminate the need for sailors to carry hard copies of their orders if they are less than 30 days.  However, it is highly recommended that
        sailors continue to carry hard copies of orders.  This new change does not affect sailors on orders longer than 30 days.
    </li>
    <h2>Minimum requirements to be in the US Navy Reserves</h2>
        <p>In the US Navy Reserves, there is a minimum requirement to stay in the Navy Reserves (27 points) and a minimum to get a "good year" (50 points).  Only a "good year" will count towards retirement.  Drill weekends usually consist of 4 points
        (Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, Sunday morning, and Sunday afternoon, each counting as 1 point respectively).  Every day you spend on Active Duty (such as on Annual Training) also counts as a point.  So in order to have a good year, you have 
        to have 40 drill points and a minimum of 12 days on Annual Training.  Every year, you cannot incur more than 24 Authorized Absences (going by drill period) or more than 8 Unauthroized Absences.  Meeting either will almost guarantee an automatic 
        separation from the Navy Reserves.  Requirements to stay in the Navy Reserves can be found at <a href="https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/instructions/BUPERSInstructions/Documents/1001.39.pdf" target="_blank">BUPERS 1001.39F</a>.  You 
        can see how many points you have per fiscal year on your Annual Statement of Service History (ASOSH), which is located in the BOL main menu.</p>
    <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>There are many different opportunities when you are a US Navy Master-at Arms Reservist. The secret to making the most of your time in the Reserves is networking with different Reservists around the country. This is the best way to find opportunities;
        such as mobilizations, additional Annual Training periods, or even more schools. In addition, while networking with different Reservists, you will come into contact with people from every profession that can assist you with your civilian career as well.
        My purpose for this website is to have a one stop resource for all Master-at-Arms Reservists, especially those who have no prior service.  This website will direct you in maintaining the minimum standards required by the Navy Reserves, and will also point 
        you in the right direction to make the most of your Reservist career!</p>
        <p> A special thanks to everyone who has provided feedback for this website.  Your efforts will help any MA Reservist who is wanting to make the most of their career.</p>
