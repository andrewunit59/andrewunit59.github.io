    <h2>Travel Announcements</h2>
    <li>As of February 23, 2020, the Navy will be launching the AT/ADT eMuster, which will eliminate the need for sailors to carry hard copies of their orders if they are less than 30 days.  However, it is highly recommended that
        sailors continue to carry hard copies of orders.  This new change does not affect sailors on orders longer than 30 days.

    <h2>First time on orders?</h2>
    <h3>If this is your first time on orders, here are some important points you should remember:</h3><br>  
    <!-- Slideshow container -->
<section class="slideshow-container">
 
    <!-- Full-width images with number and caption text -->
    <div class="mySlides fade">
      <div class="numbertext">1</div>
      <div class="text">Be sure your Anti-Terrorism Awareness Level 1 NKO is done for the fiscal year, especially if you are going on orders outside the US.</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="mySlides fade">
      <div class="numbertext">2</div>
      <div class="text">Before leaving on orders, be sure to have a reliable contact in case of travel emergencies that could arise while traveling to orders, and to know muster times when you do arrive.</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="mySlides fade">
      <div class="numbertext">3</div>
      <div class="text">If you are flying to another location for your orders and you are using DTS, please ensure you are ticketed (which you should recieve in your email) before the day you leave.  You are usually not ticketed until 3 days out, even if your DTS is approved long before then.  </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mySlides fade">
        <div class="numbertext">4</div>
        <div class="text">If you have any issues with travel by air, contact SATO, the company that takes care of DoD commercial travel reservations.  They can be reached at 1-800-865-7286.  DO NOT pay for any of your flights with a personal card if you booked them through DTS!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="mySlides fade">
        <div class="numbertext">5</div>
        <div class="text">Always carry a couple of hard copies of your NROWS orders.  Traditionally, you would turn in a pair of those orders to the local Personnel Support Detachment (PSD), who will sign your orders on your first day, and will take them for processing and pay before you check out to go home.  This is your proof that you were there on orders.
            Now with the launch of the new AT/ADT eMuster, this will no longer be necessary for orders less than 30 days, but emergency situations could arise and is officially recommended.</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="mySlides fade">
        <div class="numbertext">6</div>
        <div class="text">Be sure you keep copies of all reciepts of purchases that you use your Government Travel Credit Card (GTCC).  Within 5 business days of returning home from orders, you will need to submit a DTS voucher, listing all expenses over $50 that you used your GTCC for.  The main things this would be would be
            your travel itinerary, hotel bills, rental car (if you are given one), and gas for rental car (even if it is less that $50). </div>
